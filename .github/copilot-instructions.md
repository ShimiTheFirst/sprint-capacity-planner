# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Our Next.js Starter (Tailwind 4 Edition)

Welcome to our Next.js starter project! To ensure consistency and maintain high code quality, please follow these guidelines when using GitHub Copilot.

## General Principles

- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Prioritize writing clean, readable, and understandable code.
- **Best Practices:** Adhere to the best practices outlined below for each technology.
- **Consistency:** Follow the existing code style and patterns within the project.

## Next.js

- **App Router:** Utilize the App Router for all new routes.
- **Server Components:** Favor Server Components whenever possible to improve performance. Only use Client Components when interactivity is required.
- **Data Fetching:** Use `fetch` with `async/await` in Server Components for data fetching. For client-side data fetching, consider using Zustand in conjunction with `fetch`.
- **Route Handlers:** Implement API endpoints using Route Handlers within the `app/api` directory.
- **Metadata:** Define metadata using the `metadata` object in `layout.js` and `page.js` files for better SEO.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for data fetching and other asynchronous operations.

## shadcn/ui üé®

- **Component Usage:** Use `shadcn/ui` components for building the user interface.
- **Installation:** Add new `shadcn/ui` components using the CLI: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]`.
- **Customization:** Customize components by directly editing the files in `components/ui`. Avoid overriding styles with excessive CSS.
- **Theming:** Adhere to the defined theme **using CSS variables in your global CSS file** (`app/globals.css` or similar) when styling. Ensure `shadcn/ui` is configured to use these variables.

## Zustand üêª

- **Store Structure:** Create modular stores for different features or data domains.
- **State Immutability:** Always update state immutably within your Zustand stores.
- **Actions:** Define actions within your stores to handle state updates.
- **Selectors:** Use selectors to derive specific pieces of state within your components.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** When using Zustand with SSR, ensure proper initialization and hydration.

## Tailwind CSS v4 üå¨Ô∏è

- **Utility-First:** Embrace the utility-first approach for styling.
- **CSS Variables:** Define your design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) primarily using **CSS variables** in your main CSS file (e.g., `app/globals.css`). Tailwind v4 leverages these directly.
- **`@config` (If Used):** If you need advanced configuration beyond CSS variables, use the `@config` directive within your CSS.
- **JIT Engine:** Understand that Tailwind v4 uses a new, more performant JIT engine. Write standard Tailwind classes.
- **Avoid `@apply`:** Continue to limit the use of `@apply` to maintain the benefits of utility classes.
- **Readability:** Keep your JSX/TSX clean by organizing and grouping related utility classes.
- **Responsiveness:** Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for building responsive layouts.
- **Dark Mode:** Implement dark mode using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix, configured via CSS variables or media queries.

## JSON Data Store üìÅ

- **Location:** Store JSON data files in the `data` directory on the server.
- **Structure:** Design a clear and consistent structure for your JSON files.
- **Read/Write Operations:** Implement helper functions to handle reading from and writing to JSON files. Ensure these operations are performed on the server-side.
- **Data Validation:** Consider implementing data validation before writing to JSON files, possibly using a library like Zod.
- **Backup:** Regularly back up your JSON data files.

## VS Code & Copilot Integration

- **File Naming:** Use PascalCase for file and folder names.
